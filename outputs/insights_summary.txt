
CYCLONE MACHINE DATA ANALYSIS - COMPREHENSIVE INSIGHTS
======================================================================

SUMMARY INSIGHTS:
1. Processed 378,580 data points over 1314 days
2. Machine availability: 77.2% (268 shutdown events)
3. Total downtime: 7178.4 hours, avg shutdown: 1607 min
4. Identified 5 operational states, State 0 dominant (26.5%)
5. Detected 904 anomalous events (rate: 0.69 events/day)
6. State 0 shows highest anomaly frequency (253 events)
7. Forecasting model shows good performance (25.2% RMSE improvement)

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement predictive maintenance to reduce unplanned shutdowns
- Set up automated alerts for shutdowns exceeding 60 minutes
- Analyze shutdown patterns for seasonal maintenance planning
- Monitor state transitions for early degradation detection
- Optimize operations to maximize time in efficient states
- Investigate short-duration states for stability improvements
- Implement real-time anomaly monitoring with severity thresholds
- Focus maintenance on high-anomaly operational states
- Investigate top implicated variables for root cause analysis
- Use 1-hour forecasts for operational planning
- Consider state-aware forecasting for better accuracy
- Implement forecasting in maintenance scheduling
